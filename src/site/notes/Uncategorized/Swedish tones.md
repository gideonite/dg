Someone told me once that Swedish is a semitonal language. What does this mean? Never thought I'd be learning it, but here I am. Thank you crazy life, thank you Duolingo.

Accent seems quite different than tone. What is the relationship between them?

**In most Finland-Swedish varieties, however, the distinction between grave and acute accent is missing.**

As in English, there are many Swedish word pairs that are differentiated by stress:

formel /ˈfɔ̌rmɛl/ — 'formula'
formell /fɔrˈmɛl/ — 'formal'

Stressed syllables differentiate two tones, often described as pitch accents, or tonal word accents by Scandinavian linguists. They are called acute and grave accent, tone/accent 1 and tone/accent 2, or Single Tone and Double Tone. The actual realizations of these two tones varies from dialect to dialect.
